# SymmetricEncryptionAlgorithms-WinForms-SSTU
A program for comparing the performance of symmetric encryption algorithms implemented in the .NET Security Framework.

The program allows testing the encryption of a file or text. The program measures the time taken for encryption and decryption operations and provides a comparative analysis of the algorithms in the form of a chart. The following encryption algorithms are supported: DES, 3DES, Rijndael, and RC2. The supported modes of operation include ECB, CBC, CFB, OFB, and STS.
